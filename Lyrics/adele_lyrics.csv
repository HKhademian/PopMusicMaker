Sometimes I just feel it's only me. Who can't stand the reflection that they seeI wish I could live a little more. Look up to the sky not just the floorI feel like my life is flashing byAnd all I can do is watch and cry. I miss the air I miss my friendsI miss my mother I miss it whenLife was a party to be thrown. But that was a million years agoWhen I walk around all of the streets. Where I grew up and found my feet. They can't look me in the eyeIt's like they're scared of me. I try to think of things to sayLike a joke or a memory. But they don't recognise me now. In the light of dayI know I'm not the only one. Who regrets the things they've done. Sometimes I just feel it's only me. Who never became who they thought they'd be. I wish I could live a little more. Look up to the sky not just the floor. I feel like my life is flashing by. And all I can do is watch and cry. I miss the air I miss my friends. I miss my mother I miss it when. Life was a party to be thrown. But that was a million years ago. A million years ago
