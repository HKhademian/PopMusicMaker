3,"I'm feeling mighty lonesome. Haven't slept a wink. I walk the floor and watch the door. And in between I drink. Black Coffee. Love's a hand me down brew. I'll never know a Sunday. In this weekday roomI'm talking to the shadows. 1 o'clock to 4. And Lord, how slow the moments go. When all I do is pour. Black Coffee. Since the blues caught my eye. I'm hanging out on Monday. My Sunday dream's too dryNow a man is born to go a lovin'. A woman's born to weep and fret. To stay at home and tend her oven. And drown her past regrets. In coffee and cigarettesI'm moody all the morning. Mourning all the night. And in between it's nicotine. And not much hard to fight. Black Coffee. Feelin' low as the ground. It's driving me crazy just waiting for my baby. To maybe come aroundMy nerves have gone to pieces. My hair is turning gray. All I do is drink black coffee. Since my man's gone away"

10,"Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom. When the jungle shadows fall. Like the tick, tick, tock of the stately clock. As it stands against the wallLike the drip, drip, drip of the raindrops. When the summer shower is through. So a voice within me keeps repeating. You, you, youNight and day, you are the one. Only you beneath the moon and under the sun. Whether near to me, or far. It's no matter darling where you are. I think of you night and dayDay and night, why is it so?. That this longing for you follows wherever I go. In the roaring traffic's boom. In the silence of my lonely room, I think of youNight and day, night and day under the hide of me. There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me. And its torment won't be through. 'Til you let me spend my life making love to you. Day and night, night and dayNight and day under the hide of me. There's an oh such a hungry yearning burning inside of me.

12,"After you've gone and left me crying. After you've gone there's no denying. You'll feel blue you'll feel sad. You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had.

Love that's only slightly soiled,. Love for sale.. Who will buy?. Who would like to sample my supply?. Who's prepared to pay the price,. For a trip to paradise?. Love for sale.

24,"Your lips were like a red and ruby chalice warmer than the summer night,. The clouds were like an alabaster palace rising to a snowy height,. Each star it's own aurora borealis suddenly you held me tight,. I could see the midnight sun.I can't explain the silver rain that found me or was that moonlit veil,. The music of the universe around me or was that a nightingale,. And then your arms miraculously found me suddenly the sky turned pail,. I could see the midnight sun.Was there such a night? It's a thrill I still don't quite believe,. But after you were gone there was still some stardust on my sleeve.The pain of it may dwindle to an ember and the stars forget to shine,. And we may see the meadow in December, Icy white and crystalline,. But oh my darlin' always I'll remember when your lips were close to mine,. And I saw the Midnight Sun"

A thrill I've never known wellYou smile and then the spell was cast. And here we are in Heaven. For you are mine at lastAt last my love has come along. My lonely days are over. And life is like a songAt last the skies above are blue. My heart was wrapped up in clover. The night I looked at youYou smile and then the spell was cast. And here we are in Heaven.

The Bronx and Staten. Island too,. We'll try to cross Fifth Avenue.As black as onyx. We'll find the Bronix. Park Express,. Our Flatbush flat, I guess,. Will be a great success,. More or less.A short vacation. On Inspiration. Point we'll spend,. And in the station house we'll end.But Civic Virtue cannot destroy. The dreams of a girl and boy --. We'll turn Manhattan.

Get out of townJust disappear. I care for you much, too much. And when you're near, close to me dear. We touch too muchThe thrill when we meet is so bittersweet. That darling, it's getting me down.

64,"My mama done tol' me. When I was in pigtails. My mama done tol' me. A man's gonna sweet-talk and give you the big eyes. But when the sweet-talking's done. A man is a two-face, a worrisome thing. Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the nightNow the rain's a-fallin'. Hear the train a-callin, ""whoo-ee!"". My mama done tol' me. Hear that lonesome whistle blowin' 'cross the trestle, ""whoo-ee!"". My mama done tol' me. A-whooee-ah-whooee ol' clickety-clack's. A-echoin' back th' blues in the nightThe evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'. And the moon'll hide it's light. When you get the blues in the night. Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song. He knows things are wrong, and he's rightFrom Natchez to mobile,. From Memphis to St. Joe. Wherever the four winds blow. I been in some big towns. An' heard me some big talk. But there is one thing I know. A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing. Who'll leave you to sing the blues in the nightThe evenin' breeze'll start the trees to cryin'. And the moon'll hide it's light. When you get the blues in the night. Take my word, the mockingbird'll sing the saddest kind o' song. He knows things are wrong, and he's rightFrom Natchez to mobile,. From Memphis to St. Joe. Wherever the four winds blow. I been in some big towns. An' heard me some big talk. But there is one thing I know. A man's a two-face, a worrisome thing. Who'll leave ya to sing the blues in the night. Yes the lonely, lonely blues in the night"
65,We lived our little drama. We kissed in a field of white. And stars fell on Alabama. Last nightI can't forget the glamour. Your eyes held a tender light. While (And) stars fell on Alabama (fractured 'Bama). Last nightI never planned in my imagination. A situation - so heavenly. A fairy land where no one else could enter. And in the center - just you and meMy heart beat (just) like a hammer. (My) Arms wound around you tight. And (While) stars fell on Alabama. Last night
66,"April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom. Holiday tables under the trees. April in Paris, this is a feeling. No one can ever repriseI never knew the charm of spring. Never met it face to face. I never new my heart could sing. Never missed a warm embraceTill April in Paris, whom can I run to?. What have you done to my heart?April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom.

68,"'Neath the stars, at bazaars. Often I've had to caress men. Five or ten, dollars then, I'd collect from all those yes-men. Don't be sad, I must add, that they meant no more than chess-menDarling, can't you see?. 'Twas for charity?. Though these lips have made slips, it was never really serious. Who'd have thought, I'd be brought to a state that's so delirious?I could cry salty tears. Where have I been all these years?. Little wow, tell me now. How long has this been goin' on?There were chills up my spine. And some thrills I can't define. Listen sweet, I repeat. How long has this been goin' on?Oh, I feel that I could melt. Into heaven I'm hurled. I know how Columbus felt. Finding another worldKiss me once, then once more. What a dunce I was before. What a break, for heaven's sake. How long has this been goin' on?(spoken). Kiss me twice, once more, thrice, make it fourWhat a break, for heaven's sake. How long has this been goin' on?"

70,"Don't mind telling you, in my humble fash. That you thrill me through, with a tender pash,. When you said you care, 'magine my emoshe. I swore then and there, permanent devoshe,.

71,Skylark. Have you anything to say to me?. Won't you tell me where my love can be?. Is there a meadow in the mist. Where someone's waiting to be kissed?Oh skylark. Have you seen a valley green with spring?. Where my heart can go a journeying. Over the shadows and the rain. To a blossom covered laneAnd in your lonely flight. Haven't you heard the music in the night?. Wonderful music. Faint as a will o' the wisp. Crazy as a loon. Sad as a gypsy serenading the moonOh skylark. I don't know if you can find these things. But my heart is riding on your wings. So if you see them anywhere. Won't you lead me there. Oh skylark. Won't you lead me there?
72,"In old Savannah, I said Savannah. The weather there is nice and warm. The climate's of the southern brand. But here's what I don't understandThey've got a gal there, a pretty gal there. Who's colder than an arctic storm. Got a heart just like a stone. Even nice men leave her aloneThey call her, ""Hard hearted Hannah"". The vamp of Savannah. The meanest gal in town. Leather is tough but Hannah's heart is tougher. She's a gal who loves to see men sufferTo tease them and thrill 'em. To torture and kill 'em. Is her delight they sayI saw her at the seashore with a great big pan. There was Hannah pourin' water on a drownin' manShe's hard hearted Hannah. The vamp of Savannah, G AThe call her, ""Hard hearted Hannah"". The vamp of Savannah. The meanest gal in town. Talk of your cold refrigerating mamas. Brother she's a polar bears pajamasTo tease them and thrill 'em. To torture and kill 'em. Is her delight they sayAn evening spent with Hannah sitting on your knees. Is like travelin' through Alaska in your BVDsShe's hard hearted Hannah. The vamp of Savannah, G ACan you imagine a woman as cold as Hannah?. She's got the right name, ""The vamp of Savannah"". Anytime a woman can take a great big pan. Start pourin' water on a drownin' manShe's hard hearted Hannah. The vamp of Savannah, G-AOoh, she's sweet as sour milk"
73,"I've wined and dined on Mulligan stew and never wished for turkey. As I hitched and hiked and grifted too, from Maine to Albuquerque. Alas I missed the Beaux Arts Ball and what is twice as sad. I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca-ad. But social circles spin too fast for me. My ""hobohemia"" is the place to beI get too hungry for dinner at eight. I like the theater, but never come late. I never bother with people I hate. That's why the lady is a trampI don't like crap games with barons and earls. Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls. Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls. That's why the lady is a trampI like the free, fresh wind in my hair. Life without care. I'm broke, it's oke. Hate California, it's cold and it's damp. That's why the lady is a trampI go to Coney, the beach is divine. I go to ballgames, the bleachers are fine. I follow Winchell and read every line. That's why the lady is a trampI like a prizefight that isn't a fake. I love the rowing on Central Park lake. I go to Opera and stay wide awake. That's why the lady is a trampI like the green grass under my shoes. What can I lose, I'm flat, that's that. I'm alone when I lower my lamp. That's why the lady is a tramp"

75,"Daydream, why do you haunt me so. Deep in a rosy glow. The face of my love you showDaydream, I walk along on air. Building a castle there. For me and my love to shareDon't know the time, lordy. I'm in a daze. Sun in the sky, while I moon around, feeling, hazyDaydream, don't break my reverie. Until I find that he,. Is daydreaming just like meDaydreams, why do you haunt me so. While I'm in this rosy glow. Bring back my love. Bring back my love. Bring back my love. To me"
76,"I know too well that I'm just wasting precious timeIn thinking such a thing could be. That you could ever care for me. I'm sure you hate to hear. That I adore you, dear. But grant me just the same. I'm not entirely to blame for. You'd be so easy to love. So easy to idolize all others above. So worth the yearning for. So swell to keep every home fire burning for. We'd be so grand at the game. So carefree together. That it does seem a shame. That you can't see your future with me. 'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love. We'd be so grand at the game. So carefree together. That it does seem a shame. That you can't see your future with me. 'Cause you'd be oh, so easy to love"
77,"I used to visit all the very gay places. Those come-what-may places. Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life. To get the feel of life. Through jazz and cocktailsThe girls there all had sad and sullen gray faces. With distant gay traces. That used to be there; you could see where they'd been washed away. By too many through the day. Twelve o' clock talesThen you came along with your siren song. To tempt me to madness. I thought for awhile that your poignant smile. Was tinged with the sadness. Of a great love for me. But, oh I was wrong. Again I was wrongLife is lonely again. And only last year everything seemed so sure. Now life is awful again. A trough full of hearts would only be a boreA week in Paris would ease the bite of it. All I care is to smile in spite of it.. I'll forget you I will. While yet you are still. burning inside my brainRomance is mush. stifling those who strive. I'll live a lush life in some small diveAnd there I'll be. While I rot with the rest. of those whose lifes are lonely too."
