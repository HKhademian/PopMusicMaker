They say I'm caught up in a dream. Well, life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes. Well, that's fine by meSo wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself, and I. Didn't know I was lostSo wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself, and I. Didn't know I was lostI tried carrying the weight of the world. But I only have two hands. Hope I get the chance to travel the world. But I don't have any plansWish that I could stay forever this young. Not afraid to close my eyes. Life's a game made for everyone. And love is the prizeSo wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older. All this time I was finding myself, and I. Didn't know I was lostSo wake me up when it's all over. When I'm wiser and I'm older.

6,"Once upon a younger year. When all our shadows disappeared. The animals inside came out to play. Went face to face with all our fears. Learned our lessons through the tears. Made memories we knew would never fadeOne day my father, he told me. ""Son, don't let it slip away"". He took me in his arms, I heard him say. ""When you get older. Your wild heart will live for younger days. Think of me if ever you're afraid""He said: ""One day you'll leave this world behind. So live a life you will remember"". My father told me when I was just a child. ""These are the nights that never die"". My father told meWhen thunder clouds start pouring down. Light a fire they can't put out. Carve your name into those shining stars. He said: ""Go venture far beyond the shores. Don't forsake this life of yours. I'll guide you home, no matter where you are""One day my father, he told me. ""Son, don't let it slip away"". When I was just a kid, I heard him say. ""When you get older. Your wild heart will live for younger days. Think of me if ever you're afraid""He said: ""One day you'll leave this world behind. So live a life you will remember"". My father told me when I was just a child. ""These are the nights that never die"". My father told me""These are the nights that never die"". My father told me. My father told me"

All over town. But something flipped like a switch when you came around. And I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me togetherOoooohh[Chorus]. These are the days we've been waiting for. On days like these who could ask for more. Keep them coming. Cause we're not done yet. These are the days we won't regret. These are the days we won't forgetThese are the days we've been waiting for. Rattle the cage and slam that door. And the world is calling us. But not just yet. These are the days we won't regret. These are the days we won't forget[Verse 2]. Out on the midnight. The wild ones howl. Last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel. We used to believe we were stars aligned. You made a wish and I fell out of timeTime flew, cut through. All over town. You make me bleed when I look up. And you're not around. But I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me togetherOoooohh[Chorus]. These are the days we've been waiting for. Neither of us knows what's in store. You just roll your window down place your bets. These are the days that we won't regret.

With something to believe inMonday left me broken. Tuesday, I was through with hoping. Wednesday, my empty arms were open. Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for loveThank the stars it's Friday. I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday. Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday. I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come aroundWe are one of a kind, irreplaceable. How did I get so blind and so cynical?. If there's love in this life, we're unstoppable. No, we can't be defeatedMonday left me broken. Tuesday, I was through with hoping.

37,"That's me right there on the corner, listening to wu in my Walkman. Neon lights hit the water, reflecting the city i'm lost in. That's me right there on the corner, I one day would be leaving. For a dream that I didn't have, that i'd one day would believe in. Strange how the same place, I ran from's the same place. I think of whenever the chance comesIt's inevitable cause wherever I go. I hear echoes of a thousand screams. As I lay me down to sleep. There's a black hole deep inside of me. Reminding me. That I lost my backbone, somewhere in StockholmI lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm. I'm from a place where we never, openly show our emotions. We drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles. And leave them to float in the ocean. I'm from a place where we never, seperate people from people. Some generalize, but in general I still believe that we are treated as equals. My father, my mother, my sister, my brother, my friends and my family's there. My hope, and my money, my innocence in a sense, almost lost everything hereRight where I was founded, is right where i'll be found dead. These streets are my backbone, until I get back home. I hear echoes of a thousand screams. As I lay me down to sleep. There's a black hole deep inside of me. Reminding meThat I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm. I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm. I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns. Not in the city, but out in the burbs. A river that's dying of thirst I am a reverend. Lying in church, a crack in the patternA miracle waiting to happen. A promise that never was kept. One of those momentsYou'll never forget. I am that feeling inside, that one we all know. But can't really describe. I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still. Somewhere in Stockholm, but I'm not alone. Don't have to get, by on my own. I'm finally home. Hemma i Stockholm. DÃ¤r jag hÃ¶r hemma. I hear echoes of a thousand screams. As I lay me down to sleep. There's a black hole deep inside of me. Reminding me. That I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm. I lost my backbone, somewhere in Stockholm"
