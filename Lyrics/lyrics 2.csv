Wear Sunscreen
If I could offer you only one tip for the future,
Sunscreen would be it
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists
whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience...
I will dispense this advice now...</p>,Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth
oh nevermind;
you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded
But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself
and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before
you and how fabulous you really looked...</p>,You are not as fat as you imagine
Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as
effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that
never crossed your worried mind</p>,the kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday</p>,Do one thing everyday that scares you</p>,Sing
Don't be reckless with other people's hearts</p>,don't put up with people who are reckless with yours</p>,Floss
Don't waste your time on jealousy; sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind...</p>,the race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself
Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults</p>,if you succeed in doing this, tell me how</p>,Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements</p>,Stretch
Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your life...
the most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives
some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't</p>,Get plenty of calcium
Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone
Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't
maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't
maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding
anniversary...
what ever you do, don't congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either
your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's</p>,Enjoy your body</p>,use it every way you can...</p>,don't be afraid of it, or what other people think of it</p>,it's the greatest instrument you'll ever own</p>,Dance...even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room
Read the directions, even if you don't follow them
Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly</p>,Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good
Be nice to your siblings
they are the best link to your past
and the people most likely to stick with you in the future</p>,Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on
Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle</p>,because the older you get
the more you need the people you knew when you were young
Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard
live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft
Travel
Accept certain inalienable truths
prices will rise
politicians will philander
you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young
prices were reasonable
politicians were noble
and children respected their elders
Respect your elders
Don't expect anyone else to support you
Maybe you have a trust fund
maybe you have a wealthy spouse
but you never know when either one might run out
Don't mess too much with your hair
or by the time you're 40, it will look 85
Be careful whose advice you buy, but
be patient with those who supply it
Advice is a form of nostalgia
dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off
painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth
But trust me on the sunscreen</p>"

Did you feel us?
Another star
You fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us
Alight</p>,Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?</p>,Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?
Where are you now?</p>,Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wild inside of me</p>,I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded
I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded</p>,These shallow waters never met
What I needed
I'm letting go
A deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea
I'm breathing
Alive</p>,Where are you now?
Where are you now?</p>,Under the bright
But faded lights
You set my heart on fire
Where are you now?
Where are you now?</p>,Where are you now?</p>,Atlantis
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?

The monster's running wild inside of me</p>,I'm faded

Fireflies, a million little pieces
Feeds the dying light, and breathes me back to life
In your eyes, I see something to believe in
Your hands are like a flame
Your palms the sweetest pain</p>,[Chorus 1: Julie Bergan]
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite</p>,[Post-Chorus: Julie Bergan]
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite</p>,[Verse 2: Julie Bergan]
So alive, your touch is like the daylight
Burning on my skin, it turns me on again
You and I, survivors of the same kind
And we're the only ones
Dancing on the sun</p>,[Chorus 1: Julie Bergan]
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
Like a starship speeding into the night
You and I get lost in the infinite lights
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite</p>,[Post-Chorus: Julie Bergan]
One touch and I ignite
One touch and I ignite</p>,[Bridge: Seungri]
Diamonds are forever, but all we need is just tonight
We're monumental tremors that can freeze the speed of life
Just like particles that's falling from heaven all over the stars
Hear you calling for me
Hear you calling me on from afar</p>,[Chorus 2: Julie Bergan]
Let the darkness lead us into the light
Let our dreams get lost, feel the temperature rise
Baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite
I feel the heat as we collide
Like a fever that feels so right
So baby, tell me one more beautiful lie
One touch and I ignite</p>"

Write a paragraph

Think 'bout you like a past time
I could cry you a river
Get you baptised or
I wasn't ready to act right
Used to always think I'd get you back, right
They say that things fall apart
We were gonna move to Brooklyn
You were gonna study Art
Love is just a tool
To remind who we are
And that we are not alone
And we're walking in the dark</p>,I hope someday
We'll sit down together
And laugh with each other
About these days, these days

49,"Ladies and Gentlemen of the class of '97.
Wear sunscreen.
If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it.
The long term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience...
I will dispense this advice now.</p>,Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth; oh nevermind; you will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they have faded.
But trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked...
You're not as fat as you Imagine.</p>,Don't worry about the future; or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubblegum.
The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind.
The kind that blindside you at 4pm on some idle Tuesday.</p>,Do one thing everyday that scares you.</p>,Sing.</p>,Don't be reckless with other people's hearts, don't put up with people who are reckless with yours.</p>,Floss.</p>,Don't waste your time on jealousy;
Sometimes you're ahead,
Sometimes You're behind.
The race is long, and in the end, it's only with yourself.</p>,Remember the compliments you receive, forget the insults;
If you Succeed in doing this, tell me how.</p>,Keep your old love letters, throw away your old bank statements.</p>,Stretch.</p>,Don't feel guilty if you don't know what you want to do with your
Life.
The most interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives, some of the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't.</p>,Get plenty of calcium.</p>,Be kind to your knees, you'll miss them when they're gone.</p>,Maybe you'll marry, maybe you won't, maybe you'll have children, maybe you won't, maybe you'll divorce at 40, maybe you'll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary.
Whatever you do, don't Congratulate yourself too much or berate yourself either.
Your choices are half chance, so are everybody else's.
Enjoy your body, Use it every way you can... Don't be afraid of it, or what other people Think of it,
It's the greatest instrument you'll ever own...</p>,Dance... even if you have nowhere to do it but in your own living room.</p>,Read the directions, even if you don't follow them.</p>,Do NOT read beauty magazines, they will only make you feel ugly.</p>,Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Someday your spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there
For you.
And I'll be there, just tell me now, whenever I can.
Everybody's free.</p>,Get to know your parents, you never know when they'll be gone for good.</p>,Be nice to your siblings;
They are the best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.</p>,Understand that friends come and go, but for the precious few you should hold on.
Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older you get, the more you need the people you knew when you were young.</p>,Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard;
Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.</p>,Travel.</p>,Accept certain inalienable truths, prices will rise, politicians will Philander, you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.</p>,Respect your elders.</p>,Don't expect anyone else to support you.
Maybe you have a trust fund, Maybe you have a wealthy spouse; but you never know when either one might run out.</p>,Don't mess too much with your hair, or by the time you're 40, it will look 85.</p>,Be careful whose advice you buy, but, be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.</p>,But trust me on the sunscreen...</p>,(Brother and sister together we'll make it through
Someday your spirit will take you and guide you there
I know you've been hurting, but I've been waiting to be there
For you. And I'll be there, just tell me now, whenever I can.

In World War II the average age of the combat soldier was 26

In Vietnam were arrested since discharge
Their arrest rate is almost twice that of non-veterans of the same age
There are no accurate figures of how many of these men
Have been incarcerated</p>,But a Veterans Administration study
Concludes that the greater of vets
Exposure to combat could more likely affect his chances

World War II and Vietnam was coming home

We made a promise to never get old
You had a chance and you took it on me

But something flipped like a switch when you came around
And I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together</p>,Ooooohh</p>,[Chorus]

On days like these who could ask for more
Keep them coming

And the world is calling us
But not just yet

These are the days we won't forget</p>,[Verse 2]
Out on the midnight
The wild ones howl
Last of the lost boys have thrown in the towel
We used to believe we were stars aligned
You made a wish and I fell out of time</p>,Time flew, cut through
All over town
You make me bleed when I look up
And you're not around
But I'm in pieces, pick me up, and put me together</p>,Ooooohh</p>,[Chorus]
These are the days we've been waiting for
Neither of us knows what's in store
You just roll your window down place your bets

And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat

Jamie Harrison</p>,Sometimes these nights without you are the worst I've ever had.
I feel so scared you'll be in my dreams.
Then I would wake to find that I'm cold and alone in bed.
So sometimes I just don't go to sleep.</p>,[optional verse]
In my mind I've tried to set fire to the memories of me and you.
But inside my heart they just won't burn.
So I wait here holding on at a table set for two.
Hoping that someday you'll return.</p>,I've spent so long looking at the wrong side of the girl who was just so right.
I've spent so long looking for the best way to break our fall.
I've spent so long looking at the wrong side of the girl who was just so right.
That I failed to see that we had it all, we had it all.</p>,One wish, one dream, one hope, one false reality.
But these days there's only one night stands.
As I try to find a way to keep you off my mind.
Cause now you're now in love with some other man.</p>,I've spent so long looking at the wrong side of the girl who was just so right.
I've spent so long looking for the best way to break our fall.
I've spent so long looking at the wrong side of the girl who was just so right.
That I failed to see that we had it all.</p>,'Cause I don't even want to be here
If I won't be holding you my dear.

You know you could work for me
The way you do it causing jealousy
But you don't ever gotta worry about the enemy
They try to do it like you
And they get mad cause they don't do it successfully
They try to copy your moves

95,"High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time</p>,Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
A clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again</p>,'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why</p>,If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?</p>,If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?</p>,Walk on through a red parade
And refuse to make amends
It cuts deep through our ground
And makes us forget all common sense</p>,Don't speak as I try to leave
'Cause we both know what we'll choose
If you pull, then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you</p>,'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why</p>,If our love is tragedy, why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity, why are you my clarity?</p>,Why are you my clarity?
Why are you my remedy?

96,"Sad story, might find it boring
Lost his Mum to a drug named heroin
Father's gone, so Grandma's left with everything
Two grandkids and a daughter's coffin</p>,I never really knew him when he was growing up
But I assumed that it was a little fucked
No parents for him to look up too
Just a brother whom I knew was a dodgy fuck</p>,Shit, I used to think he was a dick
Tried too hard to fit
And never grew out of it</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck</p>,Never left his home town
That's what probably did it
Never saw the other worlds
That he didn't want to go and get it</p>,Occupied by fitting in where minds
A small west, small things
Make the small things feel so tall</p>,Will he ever change?
Well apparently
He reapplied for college and was waiting for his grades
It wouldn't help his case
Oh, I couldn't ever say</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck</p>,But wait my life's out, a night out
Brothers in town, some doubt
A few fights, now kicked out clubs, shit the suns up
One looks all it took for his girl to cuss at another</p>,Dudes being dudes
They blow at the chest to impress these breasts
That'd just started this mess
They must protect the damsel in distress
So other girls man decides to clench his fists</p>,And then he threw and missed
Brothers hit, as did his
Dropped him quick, then one kick to the head
Oh shit other man is dead</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck</p>,And now he's locked away
21 years of age
How many lives will go to waste?
As far as graves
Until I see some fucking change</p>,Oh, and I don't even know how
We can change it too
I want another life</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck</p>,Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up

97,"I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don't believe in him â his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the ""Roche""
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if I'd look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said</p>,'I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine'
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh ohh</p>,And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away</p>,Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I know it unlocks like a door</p>,And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Gotta give it up or give it away</p>,Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again</p>,It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall</p>,1, 000 lonely stars
Hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore</p>,'I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine'
I didn't want to anymore, oh oh ohh</p>,And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away</p>,Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I don't know what else I can do</p>,And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away</p>,Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I don't know what else I...
I don't understand, don't get upset I'm not with you...
We're swimming around, it's all I do
When I'm with you</p>,And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away</p>,Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I don't know what else I can do</p>,And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day

98,"Say that I'm crazy or call me a fool
But last night it seemed that I dreamed about you
When I opened my mouth what came out was a song
And you knew every word and we all sang along</p>,To a melody played on the strings of our souls
And a rhythm that rattled us down to the bone
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every bit of my proud corazÃ³n
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every bit of my proud corazÃ³n
Ay, mi familia, oiga, mi gente, canten a coro
Let it be known
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every bit of my proud corazÃ³n
Ay, mi familia, oiga, mi gente, canten a coro
Let it be known
Our love for each other will live on forever
In every bit of my proud corazÃ³n</p>"
