You would always win, always win.But I set fire to the rain,. Watched it pour as I touched your face,. Well, it burned while I cried. 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!I set fire to the rain. And I threw us into the flames. Well, it felt something died. 'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!Sometimes I wake up by the door,. That heart you caught, must be waiting for you. Even now when we're already over. I can't help myself from looking for you.I set fire to the rain,. Watch it pour as I touch your face,. Well, it burned while I cried. 'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your nameI set fire to the rain,. And I threw us into the flames. Well, it felt something died. 'Cause I knew that was the last time. The last time, oh, oh!Let it burn. Let it burn. Let it burn"
