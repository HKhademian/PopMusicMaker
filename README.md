# PopMusicMaker

Please go to https://youtu.be/WeU5xzsqPmk to see a video I made that explains what PopMusicMaker is, and how I built the machine (part 2 on evaluation and general application of my machine will be up soon).

The link for the PopMusicMaker website (made through flask): http://popmusicmaker.com

Pop Music Maker built on Decision Tree and Hidden Markov Model-like structure. Inspired by the desire to build my own model that produces better pop music than LSTMs / deep learning.
